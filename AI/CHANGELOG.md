## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.9] — 2026-06-16

🚀 NEW FEATURES
- **Adaptive launcher icon + splash screen**: Foreground/background layer icons with AMOLED-safe background; splash screen held until first-run check resolves, preventing library flash on cold start.
- **Loading primitives**: New reusable Compose components — `LoadingArc` (indeterminate spinner), `PulseDot` (animated status dot), `ShimmerSkeleton` (shimmer placeholder rows).
- **Library shimmer + PulseDot**: Library screen shows 3 shimmer card placeholders on cold start (before Room emits first value); RUNNING jobs show a `PulseDot` alongside their status chip.
- **Merge "Verifying parts…" arc** (K-017): `MergeOrderViewModel.addParts()` now sets `verifying = true` while ffprobe runs on selected parts; `MergeOrderScreen` shows `LoadingArc` + "Verifying parts…" text, with action buttons disabled until probing completes.
- **File Details loading/error state**: `FileDetailsScreen` replaces the static "Loading file metadata…" text with `LoadingArc`; probe failures are surfaced as an error card with a retry button instead of silently swallowing the exception.
- **OSS Notices screen**: Real open-source licence data served from the packaged `oss_notices.json` asset; shimmer shown while loading; each entry taps through to its licence URL.
- **Cleanup Patterns (Room)**: 12 default regex cleanup rules persisted to Room (DB v4); user can view, enable/disable, reorder, add, and delete patterns in `CleanupPatternsScreen`. Rules applied in-order to split/merge output filenames.

🔧 BUG FIXES
- K-017: Merge "Pick parts" flow no longer sits idle for 5-30 s when probing large MKV files; `LoadingArc` + disabled buttons give clear feedback during the wait.
- K-006 (mitigated): The default cleanup pattern set no longer includes the TRUE / REAL tokens that could strip words from legitimate titles ("True Lies", "Real Steel"). K-006 remains OPEN because user-added custom patterns can still hit the same edge case; the built-in defaults no longer trigger it.
- Fixed silent exception swallow in `FileDetailsViewModel`: probe errors now propagate to a visible error card in `FileDetailsScreen` instead of leaving the screen stuck on a loading state.
- Fixed `CleanupPattern` regex Pattern #7 (`markers`): removed `TRUE` and `REAL` tokens that would have stripped words from legitimate titles such as "True Lies" and "Real Steel".
- Fixed `CleanupPattern` regex Pattern #8 (`release_group`): changed from `[-.\s][A-Za-z0-9]{3,}$` (which ate trailing title words like "Endgame") to `-([A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]{2,15})$`, matching only dash-prefixed, capitalised release group tags.

📦 TECHNICAL
- Room schema migrated from v3 to v4 (`Migration_3_4`): adds `cleanup_patterns` table; seeded with 12 default patterns on first install.
- `MigrationTestHelper` test (`Migration_3_4Test`) validates schema upgrade from exported v3 JSON.
- `CleanupPatternsViewModel` and `CleanupPatternsViewModelTest` added (enable/disable, reorder, CRUD operations).
- `LibraryViewModel` gains `isInitialLoad: Boolean` flag (flipped false on first DAO emission); unit tests cover loading to loaded transition.
- `FileDetailsViewModel` refactored to sealed `UiState` (Loading / Success / Error); `FileDetailsViewModelTest` covers all three states.
- `MergeOrderState` gains `verifying: Boolean`; `try/finally` guarantees the flag resets on exception paths.
- ShimmerSkeleton implemented as `Modifier.shimmer()` extension using `rememberInfiniteTransition` + `animateFloat`; gradient sweeps left-to-right across the rendered surface (200px band over 1400px range).

## [0.0.8] — 2026-06-15

🚀 NEW FEATURES
- **First-run setup**: New install now prompts for a default save folder
  on launch (non-dismissible until set). Folder selection is unified —
  Settings, Split, and Merge all read from / write to the same source.
- **Diagnostic logs**: All app activity is now captured to local
  rotating daily log files in app cache (`logs/app-<date>.log`). 7-day
  auto-purge. SAF URIs are redacted (8-char hash) for privacy. Logs
  are accessible via Settings → "View diagnostic logs" with read,
  share (via FileProvider), and safe clear-all (active file truncated,
  not deleted — writer survives).
- **In-app update check**: Settings → "Check for updates" fetches a
  signed manifest over HTTPS, validates SHA-256, and installs via
  `PackageInstaller` session. HTTPS-only, debug builds disabled,
  malformed manifests rejected.
- **Battery optimization toggle**: Settings exposes a real
  `ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` toggle with state
  reflected via `PowerManager`.
- **Split "Analyzing" UI**: The 20-30s keyframe scan at split start
  no longer appears as stuck-at-0%. Shows an indeterminate spinner
  with "Analyzing video structure" until the first real progress.

🔧 BUG FIXES
- **Merge folder collision** (5d): When the user's chosen output
  folder already contains a sub-folder with the merge's base name,
  SAF correctly auto-creates `<name> (1)`, but the app was writing
  to `<name>/file.mkv` instead of `<name> (1)/<name> (1).mkv`. Fixed
  in Merger and Splitter; MergeResultScreen no longer crashes on
  collision.
- K-016: Fix SplitResultScreen showing fake "Bahubali" outputs on
  every split. Now reads real part filenames and sizes from the Room
  database via new SplitResultViewModel. Also removed dead Phase 3
  Jobs scaffolding (JobsScreen/JobsScreenTablet/JobsViewModel +
  Routes.JOBS) that was imported in AppNav but never routed.

📦 TECHNICAL
- Migrated SettingsViewModel from SharedPreferences to androidx
  Preferences DataStore via new `SettingsRepository`. Legacy values
  auto-migrate on first launch.
- New `OutputFolderValidator` rejects unreachable / unwritable / low-space
  / permission-revoked folders with a unified `FolderValidationDialog`
  shown across all three pickers (11 unit tests cover every branch).
- Added: androidx.datastore-preferences 1.1.1, retrofit 2.11.0,
  okhttp 4.12.0, okhttp-tls 4.12.0 (test only).
- Round-trip lossless floor confirmed at 13450.895s for the 3:44:07
  source (matches v0.0.7 baseline).
- All v0.0.7 functionality unchanged.

## [0.0.7] — 2026-06-14

🚀 NEW FEATURES
- Tap on cancelled or failed rows in S2 Library now opens a `JobDetailSheet` bottom sheet showing execution details.
- Added `JobDetailSheet` action buttons: "Retry" (spawns a new queued job, replicating parts for merge) and "Delete row".

🔧 BUG FIXES
- Fixed the native crash (SIGSEGV in libffmpegkit.so saf_close) by staging files to cache and running concat demuxer on standard filesystem paths (Fixes K-013).
- Resolved video duration drift and GOP overlap in split-then-merge round-trips by positioning `-ss` before `-i` in the Splitter for fast seek and using identical cut timestamps verbatim (Fixes K-014).

⚡ IMPROVEMENTS
- Skipped staging and temporary copying in the Merger when input and output files are on readable/writable physical paths.
- Added sequential cache cleanup of staged parts with a 5-second safety margin, freeing disk space during concat progression.
- Dynamically hides the "Step X of Y" step count prefix in progress phase labels when total steps <= 2.
- Added a 600dp max width cap for `JobDetailSheet` on tablets to prevent stretching.

📦 TECHNICAL
- Version bump to 0.0.7, versionCode 7.
- Added comprehensive instrumented tests for sequential cleanup (`MergerSequentialCleanupTest`), direct path merge (`MergerNoStagingTest`), and round-trip duration verification (`SplitMergeRoundTripTest`).

## [0.0.5] — 2026-06-12

🚀 NEW FEATURES
- Real-time engine progress reporting including ETA and MB/s metrics during splitting.
- Implemented Phase 6: Merge engine using FFmpeg `concat` demuxer and connected it to the MergeConfig UI.
- Integrated automatic file subfolder grouping logic based on title prefixes.

🔧 BUG FIXES
- Corrected the `totalParts` miscalculation bug when using Size Cap only mode.
- Fixed merge failures on Android work profiles / dual apps by using `saf:` protocol descriptors directly in the FFmpeg concat demuxer.

⚡ IMPROVEMENTS
- Added powerful regex-based filename Title Cleaner to automatically normalize messy release names (e.g. stripping codec, resolution, and release group markers).

📦 TECHNICAL
- Version bump to 0.0.5, versionCode 5.
- Deployed `deploy_release.ps1` fallback to avoid failing when GitHub CLI (`gh`) is not installed.

## How to add a new release

When a release ships, replace `[Unreleased]` with `[X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`,
then add a fresh `[Unreleased]` block below the new heading. Always:

1. Use **emoji section headers** exactly as above.
2. Only include sections that have items for that release.
3. Never write "See commits for details".
4. Keep entries to one clear sentence each.
5. Reference K-NNN from `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` when fixing a known issue.

This format produces clean `\n`-separated text for the `changelog` field
of `videosplitter-version.json`.

## Versioning

- `0.0.1` … `0.0.99` — patch series.
- After `0.0.99`, ASK USER before bumping to `1.1.0` (per [AGENTS.md §3A](../AGENTS.md)).
- Debug builds NEVER bump version.
